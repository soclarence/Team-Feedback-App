# Team Feedback App

I built this project as a way to practice building a web application and getting familiar with tools, packages and libraries such as _**React Router, Framer motion, tailwind css and JSON-server.**_

Took me a total of 14days to build (I documented my process on [Tiktok](https://www.tiktok.com/@3diale.dev))

It's a straight forward feedback application. 
- You get on the landing page, click the button to get started or view prototype
- You put in the information you want and select a rating from 1-5
- Click the arrow to get a preview of your response which you can edit or delete, and
- When you're done, you click done.

it will take you to the thank you page and then go from there to the HR dashboard where you can view responses.
