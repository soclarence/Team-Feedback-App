# Team Feedback App

I built this project as a way to practice building a web application adn getting familiar with tools, packages and libraries such as _**React Router, tailwind css and JSON-server.**_

Took me a total of 14days to build (I documented my process on [Tiktok](https://www.tiktok.com/@3diale.dev))
